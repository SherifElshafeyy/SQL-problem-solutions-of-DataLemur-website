This repository contains my solutions to SQL problems from the [Datalemur](https://datalemur.com/questions?category=SQL) website. The problems are designed to improve SQL skills, covering a wide range of concepts from basic queries to advanced analytical functions.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

- **`.sql` files are placed directly in the root directory of this repository.  
Each file is named based on the problem title or ID, e.g., `problem_customer_orders.sql`.

- **`README.md`**: This file provides an overview of the repository.

## Topics Covered

- Basic SELECT queries  
- JOINs (INNER, LEFT, RIGHT, FULL)  
- Aggregation and grouping (`GROUP BY`, `HAVING`)

- Window functions (`ROW_NUMBER`, `RANK`, etc.)
